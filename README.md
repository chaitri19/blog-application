# Creating a Blog-Application
Here I am creating a blog application which would accept blog contents, related images and title from users. After users submits the required information it gets stored to our database and information can be seen on home page. User can read complete content of blog by clicking over read more option there. User can edit the blog information and can delete certain blog information thereby updating the same changes to database.
